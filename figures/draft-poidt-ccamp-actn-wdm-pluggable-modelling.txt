     Modelling of Optical Pluggables in Packet Over Optical Network
         draft-poidt-ccamp-actn-wdm-pluggable-modelling-latest

Abstract

   This draft outlines the modeling of optical pluggables within a host
   packet device within the context of a packet over optical network.
   The model encompasses all pertinent properties of the pluggable for
   various packet over optical use cases and is partitioned into three
   primary areas: the optical media interface, the electrical plug to
   host interconnect, and the physical equipment of the pluggable.

   Included in the model are representations of configuration, states,
   and telemetry data, as well as profiles and coherent plug
   capabilities.  Emphasizing the importance of considering both vendor-
   agnostic and vendor-specific attributes in modeling coherent
   pluggables.

   Drawing from existing models in IETF, OpenConfig, ITU-T, OIF, and
   TAPI, this model offers enhanced uniform structuring and naming.
   Additionally, it provides insight into the mapping to plug interface
   structures defined in CMIS.

2.  Introduction

   Packet traffic has been transmitted across optical networks for many
   years, leveraging the advantages of optical transmission and
   switching combined with packet switching.  Traditionally, optical
   systems and packet systems have been distinct, each with their own
   dedicated devices.

   In numerous network setups, packet and optical networks have been
   engineered, operated, and managed separately, leading to siloed
   operations that can be suboptimal and inefficient.  The evolution of
   both packet and optical systems has largely been independent.
   Optical systems, in particular, have seen advancements in capacity,
   especially with the adoption of coherent optical techniques.

   Advancements in optical component design have led to increased
   density, enabling entire coherent optical terminal systems that
   previously required multiple circuit packs to now fit into a single
   small form factor "coherent pluggable."  Integrating coherent
   pluggables into devices with packet functions can result in reduced
   network costs, power consumption, and footprint, while also enhancing
   data transfer rates, reducing latency, and expanding capacity,
   although in some cases, separate packet and optical solutions may
   still be preferred due to other engineering and deployment
   considerations.

   These trends, coupled with the desire to utilize the best components
   available, have given rise to open optical pluggables.  These
   pluggables allow a plug from one vendor to be installed in a device
   from another vendor with packet functions.  Communication between
   coherent pluggables and the packet device host occurs through the
   CMIS standard developed by OIF [OIF-CMIS].

   While standardized transmission modes like ZR can handle basic
   applications, proprietary modes from vendors are often necessary to
   achieve optimal performance.

   This draft outlines the modeling of an optical pluggable within a
   host packet device within the context of a packet over optical
   network.  The model presented in this document consolidates various
   properties of optical pluggables into three key areas:

   *  Optical media interface: This defines the characteristics of the
      optical solution such as spectrum, polarization, and dispersion,
      which do not directly affect the behavior of the host packet
      device.

   *  Electrical plug-to-host interconnect: This defines the
      characteristics of the bus interconnect between the host and the
      plug, such as lane count and FEC, which both the optical pluggable
      and the packet host must understand and act upon.

   *  Physical and functional aspects of the pluggable: This defines
      attributes of the optical pluggable itself, such as plug type,
      version, thermal characteristics, and power consumption, which
      indirectly affect the packet host.

   The coherent pluggable model provides representations for
   capabilities, profiles, configurations, and states and telemetry
   data.  Capabilities are defined in profiles related to operational
   modes, with some capabilities potentially being proprietary
   Configurations include attributes for optical settings, monitoring
   capabilities, and test capabilities, while state and telemetry data
   include dynamic properties such as performance monitoring collections
   and alarm notifications.

   Both vendor-agnostic and vendor-specific attributes are important
   considerations in the modeling of coherent pluggables.

   The document is divided into the following sections:

   *  Section 3: Packet over optical converged network context

   *  Section 4: Coherent Pluggables Building Blocks

   *  Section 5: Coherent Pluggables Data Modeling

   *  Section 6: Coherent Pluggables Yang Model
